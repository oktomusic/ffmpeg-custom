# Security Policy

Since this is a custom build of FFmpeg, security problems would generally be fixed in
the underlying FFmpeg project. Please refer to their security policy for supported versions
and reporting procedures: https://ffmpeg.org/security.html

The Oktomusic will then update this custom build to include the necessary patches.

You may email [afcm.contact@gmail.com](mailto:afcm.contact@gmail.com) for a faster update.
